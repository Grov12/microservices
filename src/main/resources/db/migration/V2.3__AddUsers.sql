    'Big Sur is big country. The Big Sur Retreat takes you to the most majestic part of the Pacific Coast and show you the secret trails.',
    'The region know as Big Sur is like Yosemite''s younger cousin, with all the redwood scaling, rock climbing and, best of all, hiking that the larger park has to offer. Robison Jeffers once said, ''Big Sur is the greatest meeting of land and sea in the world,'' but the highlights are only accessible on foot.\nOur 3-day tour allows you to choose from multiple hikes led by experienced guides during the day, while comfortably situated in the evenings at the historic Big Sur River Inn. Take a tranquil walk to the coastal waterfall at Julia Pfeiffer Burns State Par or hike to the Married Redwoods. If you''re prepared for a more strenuous climb, try Ollason''s Peak in Toro Park. An optional 4th day includes admission to the Henry Miller Library and the Point Reyes Lighthouse.',
